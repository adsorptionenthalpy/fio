SOFTWARE EVALUATION AGREEMENT
By accessing software in this Github directory and all of its sub directory, you (the “Licensee”) are expressing your
desire to use, evaluate and conduct tests on the software commonly known as the Foundation for Interwallet
Operability (FIO) blockchain software also known as the FIO Protocol and related documentation and materials
(collectively, the “Software”) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The Foundation for Interwallet
Operability (“Foundation”) is willing to provide, within the protection of a confidential relationship, access to the
Software to Licensee during the Evaluation Period set forth below.  In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:

LICENSE GRANT.  During the Evaluation Period and subject to Licensee’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Foundation grants to Licensee a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license
to install and use the Software internally only to test and evaluate the Software.

RESTRICTIONS.  Licensee acknowledges that the Software and its structure, sequence, organization and source code contain
valuable trade secrets of Foundation and its suppliers.  Accordingly, Licensee shall not, nor shall it permit, assist
or encourage any third party to:  (a) modify, adapt, alter, or create derivative works from the Software; (b) merge the
Software with other software; (c) sublicense, lease, rent, or loan the Software, or otherwise transfer the Software to
any third party; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the
Software, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding
this limitation; or (e) otherwise exercise rights to the Software except as expressly allowed under Section 1.

OWNERSHIP.  As between the parties, the Software, and all worldwide intellectual property rights and proprietary rights
relating thereto or embodied therein, are the exclusive property of Foundation and its suppliers.  Foundation and its
suppliers reserve all rights in and to the Software not expressly granted to Licensee in Section 1.  To the extent
Licensee modifies or creates derivative works of the Software (“Modifications”), Licensee hereby assigns to Foundation
all right, title, and interest, including all worldwide intellectual property rights, in and to the Modifications to
Foundation.

TERMINATION; RETURN OF SOFTWARE.  This Agreement is effective on the first day of your access to the Foundation’s
software Github. Either party may terminate this Agreement, with or without cause, immediately upon written notice to
the other party.  Upon the expiration or any termination of this Agreement, the license granted to Licensee hereunder
will terminate and Licensee, at its expense, will immediately cease use of the Software and uninstall and return all
copies of the Software and all Confidential Information in its possession to Foundation.  The provisions of Sections 2,
 3 and 5 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason.

CONFIDENTIALITY; PUBLICITY. “Confidential Information” means the Software, all information provided by Foundation to
Licensee regarding or about the Software, and all information provided by Foundation that is clearly marked as
confidential.  Licensee shall maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. License shall not (a)
disclose Confidential Information to any third party or (b) use Confidential Information for any purpose other than to
evaluate the Software during the Evaluation Period.  Licensee shall protect all Confidential Information from
unauthorized access and use with the same degree of care as it accords to its own confidential information which, in no
event, shall be less than reasonable care

GENERAL.  Licensee shall comply with all laws, regulations, rules, ordinances and orders applicable to its use of the
Software.  Licensee may not assign or delegate, directly or indirectly, by operation of law, change of control or
otherwise, this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any third party, and any attempt
to do so will be void and of no effect.  This Agreement will be subject to and governed by the laws of the Cayman
Islands as applied to agreements made, entered into and performed solely in Cayman Island residents.  For any litigation
arising from or related to this Agreement, the parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the
state and federal courts located in Cayman Islands.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Foundation shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any threatened or ongoing breach of this Agreement.
All modifications, waivers and amendments must be in writing and signed by both parties.  Any waiver or failure to
enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such
provision on any other occasion.  If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions hereof shall be unaffected and continue in full force and
effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject hereof and
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings and communications, whether written or oral.
